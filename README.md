## 🧑‍🔧 Skills

### Teamwork and Collaboration

While I am capable of working independently, I truly excel when collaborating within a team. Throughout my roles as a shop manager and receptionist, I placed a strong emphasis on nurturing robust relationships among team members. This comes naturally to me, largely due to my friendly disposition. Teamwork holds significant importance for me, as it consistently fosters a productive work environment and enhances overall performance. These abilities were especially valuable during my time at Makers, particularly when collaborating on group projects like MyPlace, Acebook and MakersBnB. I consistently ensured the well-being of all team members and encouraged open communication.

### Problem-solving

Solving problems and puzzles has always been a passion of mine. However, my role as a shop manager at Pixxa significantly boosted my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Managing a shop presented me with unique challenges each day, prompting me to develop a much deeper understanding of problem assessment. This involved analysing the causes, considering a diverse range of potential solutions, and ultimately making well-informed decisions. The invaluable insights I gained at Pixxa greatly improved my academic journey, particularly during my business studies at the University of West London and my time at Makers, where problem-solving skills were indispensable for success.

### Active-listener

My professional background primarily involves client-focused roles, which require me to engage with stakeholders across different organizational levels. One crucial lesson I've gleaned is the great importance of effective communication. However, when working with clients, I've realised that being an active listener can prove to be even more advantageous. Therefore, I worked on this aspect and improved it throughout the years.  As a result, I now possess the capability to swiftly and clearly comprehend the needs and requirements of stakeholders, leading to the delivery of significantly improved services and products.

### Flexible and Adaptable

I have a knack for easily adapting to changing circumstances, fully understanding the dynamic nature of today's world and business landscape. While working at SoloAffitti Inc., I honed my ability to swiftly respond to shifts in the market and the evolving needs of clients to ensure a seamless balance between supply and demand. Since then, I have consistently nurtured and strengthened this vital skill. During my time at Makers, adaptability played a crucial role in overcoming various challenges encountered in group projects, including adjustments in product requirements.

### Time-management

Since my childhood, I have been raised with the idea that first impressions are memorable and punctuality acts as someone's introduction. During my role as an estate agent, punctuality was a top priority. Therefore, I personally committed to consistently arriving at appointments 10 minutes ahead of schedule, as I believed that being late could compromise my credibility. I can confidently assert that I'm not a procrastinator, I prefer to plan ahead and meticulously organise my schedule to prevent extreme stress when working towards deadlines. My time at Pixxa contributed significantly to the improvement of my time-management abilities. The solid foundation I acquired allowed for more effective organisation, both in my university studies while simultaneously working to support myself, as well as in managing my projects at Makers.

- Pair Programming: This practice fostered knowledge sharing, collaboration, and code quality improvement. It has accelerated my growth as a developer and made problem-solving more enjoyable.
