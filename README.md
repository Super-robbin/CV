## üßë‚Äçüîß Skills

### Teamwork and Collaboration

Although I can work alone, I definitely thrive when working in a team. During my experiences as shop manager and receptionist, I focused on building strong relationship between team members. It is something that comes naturally to me, mainly because of my friendly personality. I tend to value collaboration, it generally leads to healthy working environment and improved performances. These skills came useful at Makers when working on group projects like MakersBnB and Acebook. I always made sure that everyone in the team was doing well and felt free to speak up.

### Problem-solving

I have always liked solving problems and riddles. However, my experience at Pixxa as shop manager significantly improved my critical thinking and my approach towards problems. When managing a shop, everyday was a different challenge. I developed a much deeper understanding on how to eveluate problems by finding the causes, analysing a range of possible solutions and eventually making a decision. The valuable knowledge gained at Pixxa ensured a much stronger journey during my business studies at University of West London and Makers, where problem-solving was key to succeed.

### Active-listener

Most of my working experiences were client based, thus I had to be able to deal with stakeholders at all levels. One key thing that I have learnt is that communication is really important, but when working with clients, being an active listener may be more beneficial. Therefore, I worked on this aspect and improved it throughout the years. As a result, I am now able to understand stakeholders' needs/requirements much faster and clearer, and deliver a much better service/product.

### Flexible and Adaptable

I tend to easily adapt to changes, I understand that today's world is constantly evolving and so are the businesses. At SoloAffitti Inc., I learnt how to quickly react to market changes and clients' needs in order to maintain a stable flow between demand and offer. Since then, I continously grew this essential skill and made it stronger. At Makers, being adaptable helped me to overcome the different challenges encountered throuhout the group projects, such as changes in product requirements.

### Time-management

Since I was a kid, I grew up with the idea that a first impression sticks on people's minds and that punctuality is like a business card, it introduces yourself. When I was working as estate agent, one of my main priority was to show up 10 minutes earlier than the appointment because I felt like being late would affect my credibility. I can strongly claim not to be a procrastinator, I like to plan in advance and organise my schedule, in order not to struggle with deadlines. Pixxa was a great experience to further expand time-management practices. Having a solid structure allowed me to organise my studies at university, while working to support myself, and at Makers.

## üìö Education

### Makers Academy (July 2023 - October 2023)

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Developed skills in creating small, reusable components (objects) that can be combined to create complex systems. This approach has made my code more organised and easier to maintain.
- Agile Methodologies: Built expertise in prioritising iterative and incremental development. It involves close collaboration with stakeholders, continuous feedback, and adaptability to changing requirements.
- Test-Driven Development (TDD): This software development approach boosted my confidence in writing codes, catching bugs, and making code maintenance to meet the specified requirements using frameworks such as Pytest, Jest, Playwright, and Cypress.
- Pair Programming: This practice fostered knowledge sharing, collaboration, and code quality improvement. It has accelerated my growth as a developer and made problem-solving more enjoyable.
- EQ Training on Feedback: It involves active listening, empathy, and constructive communication. Improved ability to understand others' perspectives, handle criticism gracefully, and provide feedback that is helpful rather than hurtful.
